what is block-elements in html ?
Block elements in HTML are elements that take up the full width available and start on a new line. They create a "block" of content, which means that they stack vertically in the layout. Common block elements include:
- `<div>`: A generic container for grouping content.
- `<p>`: Represents a paragraph of text.
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`: Headings of different levels.
- `<ul>`: An unordered list.
- `<ol>`: An ordered list.
- `<li>`: A list item, which is used within `<ul>` or `<ol
>`.> 
- `<header>`: Represents introductory content or a group of navigational links.
- `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a section or page.
- `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, or site.
- `<aside>`: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as sidebars or pull quotes.
- `<nav>`: Represents a section of navigation links.
- `<blockquote>`: Represents a section that is quoted from another source.
- `<figure>`: Represents self-contained content, often with an optional caption.
- `<form>`: Represents a section of a document that contains interactive controls for submitting information.
Block elements can contain other block elements or inline elements, and they are typically used to structure the layout of a webpage. They differ from inline elements, which only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line. Examples of inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`. Understanding the distinction between block and inline elements is crucial for effective web design and layout management.
